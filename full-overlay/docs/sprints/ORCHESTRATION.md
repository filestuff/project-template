# Sprint Orchestration Protocol (full tier)

How a session fans a **wave** of sprints out to parallel subagents and integrates the
results, for {{PROJECT_NAME}}. The `/sprint wave` command defers to this file. This is the
**full tier only** — it relies on the worktree + file-claims + main-lock machinery described in
`PROTOCOL.md` ("Parallel Sprints"). Read that first; this document only adds the orchestration
layer on top.

Waves are **multi-session safe**: two terminal sessions can each drive their own wave on the
same repo. Each wave gets an id (`W-<date>-<hex>`, minted by `reserve-wave.sh`), a committed
reservation of its members, and its own ledger directory. See "Running waves from multiple
sessions" below.

## The division of labor

The trick that makes this safe: **the orchestrator owns everything that mutates `main` or needs
human judgment; subagents only write into files they are explicitly handed.** The orchestrator
stays lean — it never reads sprint bodies, diffs, or code into its own context; subagents
return short structured summaries or file paths.

| Owner | Does | Touches |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Orchestrator** (this session — the "master") | Compute + reserve the wave; run the planning pass (dispatch planners, batch the decision round, write answers into sprint files, two locked commits); per sprint run start (dep check, claims check, `start.sh` under the lock, create the worktree); dispatch `sprint-executor` subagents; **advise** blocked subagents (see The advisor loop); collect reports; **serialize** Phase 3 completions; adjudicate review findings | `main` (lock-serialized), the ledger docs, the user |
| **Planning subagent** (`sprint-planner`, one per unplanned/stale sprint) | Verify + deepen ONE sprint file against current `main`: staleness, contract drift, deliverable detail, `touches:`, decision-ready questions; set `plan_date` | its assigned sprint file only (in the wave's planning worktree — the orchestrator commits) |
| **Wave-planning subagent** (`wave-planner`, conditional) | Cross-sprint constraint check when planner reports signal it (shared foundations, contract misalignment) | the wave's wave-plan.md only |
| **Execution subagent** (`sprint-executor`, one per sprint) | PROTOCOL **Phase 2 only** — verify the brief, implement deliverables test-first, gate, commit atomically, run a `reviewer` child before DONE — inside its assigned worktree; may spawn read-only Explore/debug children (see Executor children) | its worktree branch only + its report file |
| **Reviewer subagent** (`reviewer`) | Per-sprint branch review (as the executor's child) and the post-wave broad review over merged `main` | nothing — findings list only |

Every subagent role has an agent definition under `.claude/agents/` with `model: sonnet`
pinned — **never dispatch a definition-less generic subagent in a wave**; there is no
spawn-time model override, so it would silently inherit the master's (expensive) model.

The orchestrator's primary checkout stays parked on `main` (it is the lifecycle ledger). It
**never** enters a worktree — it creates them with `git worktree add` and hands the path to a
subagent.

## Worktree mode: path-scoped (verified)

Subagents operate **entirely through `git -C <worktree>` and absolute paths** — they do
**not** call `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree`. This avoids any reliance on session-global
worktree state across concurrent subagents and rests only on per-subagent Bash isolation +
git's own worktree concurrency safety (both confirmed: concurrent subagents each created a
worktree, committed, and saw no `index.lock`/ref contention, with no `cd` leakage between them).

A subagent works in its worktree by either `cd`-ing into it within its own Bash calls (its cwd
is private to that subagent) or prefixing every command with `git -C <path>` / using absolute
paths for file edits. Either is fine; never use `EnterWorktree`.

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Compute the wave

1. `node scripts/sprint/claims.mjs waves`. Take **Wave 1's startable members** — the `backlog`
   entries. Skip anything tagged `(in flight)` (another agent already owns it), `(reserved
   W-…)` for a wave id that is not yours (another session's roster — treat like in-flight),
   or `⚠️ no claims` (it isn't parallel-safe — run it solo via plain `/sprint start`). Members
   tagged `⚠ unplanned` or `⚠ stale plan` stay in the wave — Step 2 plans them before dispatch.
2. Present the set to the user and confirm — per member: ID, goal, points, plan status
   (`plan_date` or unplanned/stale), and open-question count. A wave of 2–4 is typical; more
   than that, ask whether to cap it.

### Step 1.5 — Reserve the wave

`bash scripts/sprint/reserve-wave.sh S-A S-B …` — a locked `main` commit that mints the wave
id (`W-<date>-<hex>`, printed) and writes `wave: W-<id>` into each member's frontmatter.
From this commit on, `claims.mjs` treats the members as claim holders: another session's wave
can neither reserve them nor reserve/start anything whose `touches:` overlap theirs.

- Exit 2 (member gone / already reserved / claims overlap): another session moved first —
  recompute Step 1 and re-confirm a smaller or different roster.
- Record the wave id, then create the wave's ledger dir (see Durable progress ledger):
  `.claude/sprint-orchestration/W-<id>/`.
- A member that later leaves the roster is released at that moment with
  `reserve-wave.sh --drop W-<id> S-NNN`; the whole reservation is released at wave end (or
  abandonment) with `--release W-<id>`.

### Step 2 — Plan the wave

The sprint file is each execution subagent's **entire brief** — a thin file makes a thin
agent. This step brings every member's file to execution-ready before anything starts.

**2a — Skip check (mechanical, no body reads).** A member skips the planning subagent iff
ALL hold: `plan_date` is set; no `depends_on` sprint has `end_date` after it (i.e. not
`⚠ stale plan`); `touches:` is populated; and no cross-sprint signal implicates it (2c). For
skipped members, still grep their unchecked `## Open Questions` items (`- [ ]` lines) and
feed any into the decision round (2e). A wave planned just-in-time via `/sprint plan`
typically skips everything; later waves typically re-plan — that is the intended cost
profile. If **every** member skips, no planning worktree is needed — go straight to 2e.

**2b — Planning fan-out (parallel, in a planning worktree).** First create the wave's
planning worktree:
`git worktree add .claude/worktrees/wave-W-<id>-plan -b wave-W-<id>-plan main`.
Then dispatch one **`sprint-planner`** subagent per non-skipped member, all in a single
message, using the **Planning dispatch prompt** below — pass only the sprint ID, the
absolute backlog-file path **inside the planning worktree**, the repo root, the wave roster
(IDs + `touches:`), and the sprints landed since its `plan_date`. Planners edit their
(pairwise-distinct) files in the worktree; the primary checkout — the ledger — **stays
clean throughout**, so other waves' locked transactions are never blocked by this pass.

**2c — Wave constraints check.** Always (orchestrator, mechanical): after the planners
return, re-run the wave math **against the planning worktree** (it holds the corrected
`touches:`): `SPRINT_ROOT=<planning-worktree> node scripts/sprint/claims.mjs waves` and,
per member, `SPRINT_ROOT=<planning-worktree> node scripts/sprint/claims.mjs check --sprint
S-NNN` — touches corrections may have broken pairwise disjointness; a member that now
overlaps drops to a later wave (`reserve-wave.sh --drop`). Step 3's `start.sh` re-checks
claims against the live ledger anyway — that check is authoritative. Scan the planner
reports' `CROSS_SPRINT` / `CONTRACT_DRIFT` lines. Record everything in the wave's
`wave-plan.md`. **Conditionally**: if any CROSS_SPRINT signal fires (e.g. a shared file all
members need, contract misalignment between members), dispatch one **`wave-planner`**
subagent to read the affected sprint files + code and propose a reshape — classic outcome:
extract a **foundation sprint** that the members then `depends_on` (create it via
`/sprint create` + `/sprint plan`, add the edges with `frontmatter.mjs set`, recompute
waves; affected members drop out of this wave — `--drop` them).

**2d — Locked commit #1 (deepen).** `lock.sh acquire wave-plan-deepen-W-<id>` → copy the
planners' edits onto the ledger:
`cp <planning-worktree>/docs/sprints/backlog/<file> <root>/docs/sprints/backlog/<file>`
per roster file (a plain copy — the planners' edits are uncommitted working-tree state in
the planning worktree, so `git checkout <branch> -- <path>` would NOT see them; the copy is
safe because reserved files cannot move on `main` — only lifecycle scripts move them, and
they are reserved) → `node scripts/sprint/regen.mjs` (the waves block depends on touches) →
commit `sprint: wave-plan deepen W-<id> — S-A,S-B,…` (explicit backlog-file paths +
INDEX/ROADMAP, `--no-verify`) → push → release. Deepening is committed even for members
that later drop — the work keeps its value and its `plan_date`.

**2e — Decision round (no lock held).** Batch **all** members' questions into AskUserQuestion
calls (≤4 questions each), labeled `S-NNN D-A: …` with the planner's options. More than ~8
total questions is a planning smell — the per-planner cap is 2–3; push back rather than
relay a quiz. `NOT_READY` / `SPLIT_SUGGESTED` verdicts surface here as defer / split /
proceed-anyway choices — never silently drop a member (and `--drop` whatever the user
defers).

**2f — Apply decisions + locked commit #2.** Entirely under the lock (the orchestrator's
own edits take seconds — the ledger must not sit dirty outside it):
`lock.sh acquire wave-decisions-W-<id>` → append each answer to the sprint file's
**Pre-Sprint Decisions** section as `- YYYY-MM-DD (wave): [decision] — [rationale]`, check
off the answered Open Questions items, apply any option-implied edits the planner
pre-declared → re-run `claims.mjs waves` if decisions shifted touches → commit
`sprint: wave decisions W-<id> — S-A,S-B,…`, push, release. Zero questions → 2e/2f collapse
to nothing. Finally remove the planning worktree (`--force`: it still holds the planners'
uncommitted edits, which 2d already copied and committed):
`git worktree remove --force .claude/worktrees/wave-W-<id>-plan && git branch -D wave-W-<id>-plan`.

### Step 3 — Start each sprint + create its worktree (orchestrator, serialized)

For each remaining member, in the primary checkout:

1. **Staleness re-check (cheap, mechanical — matters when other waves are landing).** List
   sprints landed since this wave's deepen commit:
   `git log --oneline --diff-filter=A <deepen-sha>..HEAD -- docs/sprints/done/`. Empty →
   proceed. Non-empty → grep this member's sprint-file body for paths matched by the landed
   sprints' `touches:`; an intersection means the brief's read-only premises (`Reference:`/
   `Interface:` citations) may cite moved code — re-dispatch a `sprint-planner` for that
   member first (verify-only; the executor's verify-the-brief step remains the backstop).
2. Dependency check → `claims.mjs check --sprint S-NNN` (stop/ask on overlap) →
   `start.sh S-NNN --wave W-<id>` **without `--touches`** (the file's manifest was verified
   in Step 2; the start commit lands on `main` under the lock; when another wave is live,
   add `--wait 900`) → `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/S-NNN-… -b S-NNN-… main` (from
   the post-start main tip; **no EnterWorktree**) → setup (copy env files, install deps with
   `{{PACKAGE_MANAGER}}`).

These run one-at-a-time: `start.sh` serializes on the lock anyway (each start is a fast
commit, so brief contention). PROTOCOL Phase 1's doc validation and tradeoff questions are
already covered by Step 2 (doc drift recorded in each file's PLAN NOTES; decisions in
Pre-Sprint Decisions).

### Step 4 — Fan out execution (parallel subagents)

Dispatch **one `sprint-executor` subagent per sprint, all in a single message** (multiple tool
calls in one turn = they run concurrently). Use the **Execution dispatch prompt** below.
**File-based handoff:** pass only the sprint ID + worktree path + wave ledger dir — the sprint
file *is* the brief; the subagent reads it. Do not paste the sprint's contents into the prompt
(it would bloat your context for the rest of the session).

Before returning DONE, the executor runs a `reviewer` child over its branch diff and fixes all
Critical/Important findings — **Step 5 receives reviewed work**, and the report discloses the
review outcome.

A subagent returns one of: **DONE** (deliverables complete, reviewed, acceptance evidence
gathered, report file written), **BLOCKED** / **NEEDS_CLAIM** (handle via The advisor loop
below), or **PLAN_GAP** (the brief is wrong or too thin to execute — see Failure handling).

### The advisor loop

The master is the executors' first line of support — most blockers should die here without
reaching the user. A **BLOCKED** return arrives in the executor's structured form (QUESTION /
CONTEXT / OPTIONS / DEFAULT). Handle it:

1. **Answer from what you already hold**: the sprint's Pre-Sprint Decisions, the wave's
   wave-plan.md, your own plan context from Steps 1–2. Most blockers are already decided
   there.
2. **Answer from the repo**: a *targeted* read (a config file, an interface, a doc) is fine —
   but never the sprint's diff or body wholesale; that budget belongs to Step 5/6 survival.
3. **Escalate to the user** only when it is a genuine product/architecture tradeoff you
   cannot decide: AskUserQuestion, batched if several sprints are blocked at once, labeled
   `S-NNN: …` with the executor's OPTIONS.

Deliver the answer by **continuing the same subagent (SendMessage) — not a fresh dispatch**:
its context (partial work, dead ends already explored) is the most valuable thing it has.
Re-dispatch fresh only if the agent died (see Failure handling). For **NEEDS_CLAIM**: run
`claims.mjs add S-NNN <path>` under the lock (checks the path is free of other in-flight
sprints *and* other waves' reservations), then continue the subagent with "claim granted —
mirror the touches: addition in your branch copy and proceed."

Recording: the executor writes the answer into its sprint file's Pre-Sprint Decisions as
`- YYYY-MM-DD (wave, in-flight): [decision] — [rationale]` (the file lives in its worktree);
the master mirrors one line into the wave's wave-progress.md.

### Executor children

Executors may spawn their own subagents — at most 2–3 per sprint: **Explore** (read-only
recon of an unfamiliar subsystem), **reviewer** (the mandatory pre-completion review), and
**debug** (a failure that resists two root-cause attempts). Every child prompt must restate
the worktree path + `git -C` discipline (never EnterWorktree), the `touches:` list (report,
never edit, outside it), and "do not commit — the parent commits". Children are leaves —
they never spawn further agents. An executor that needs more children than this is holding a
brief that is too thin: that is a PLAN_GAP, not a staffing problem. (Full rules live in
`.claude/agents/sprint-executor.md`.)

### Step 5 — Serialize completions (orchestrator, one at a time)

**Do NOT fan out `/sprint done`.** `merge-sprint.sh` holds the main-lock across
`prepare → land → finish`, *including the exit-4 pause where you apply the semantic docs* — so
racing completions make all but one hit the lock ceiling (exit 75). Complete finished sprints
**sequentially**. For each:

1. **Pre-draft the semantic docs before taking the lock** (mandatory when another wave is
   live, recommended always): write the DOC_HEALTH rows/History entry, INDEX Done-row, and
   ROADMAP narrative into `.claude/sprint-orchestration/W-<id>/S-NNN-docs-draft.md`. The
   exit-4 pause then becomes "apply the draft" — seconds of lock-held time, not minutes.
2. Run PROTOCOL **Phase 3** in full: acceptance-evidence check — work from the sprint's
   report file in `.claude/sprint-orchestration/W-<id>/`, spot-checking citations, instead of
   re-interrogating the worktree. The check now also covers the report's **review section**:
   the reviewer child ran, Critical/Important findings were fixed or escalated, declined
   findings have recorded reasons — adjudicate that from the report; do not read the diff.
   Then doc sync → `/adr check` → `prepare` (add `--wait 900` when another wave is live) →
   `land` → apply the docs draft → `finish`.
3. Remove the sprint's worktree, then move to the next.

A sprint that lands changes (`prepare` exit 3) re-runs the gate in its worktree before
`land`, lock held — that serialization is the point.

### Step 6 — Review, then the next wave

After the wave's sprints have all landed on `main`, dispatch one **`reviewer`** subagent
(fresh context) over the merged wave result on `main` — a fresh reviewer catches cross-sprint
integration issues per-sprint review can't. Hand it the wave's report-file paths as a starting
map. The master does **not** perform this review itself: it adjudicates the returned findings
list — fix now (small), spin a follow-up sprint, or accept — and records the disposition in
wave-plan.md.

Then close out the wave: `reserve-wave.sh --release W-<id>` if any backlog members still
carry the reservation (deferred/split members), and recompute `claims.mjs waves` —
newly-unblocked sprints form the next wave. Members whose `plan_date` predates the sprints
that just landed are tagged `⚠ stale plan` and re-enter Step 2a automatically on the next
wave. Repeat from Step 1 (a new wave = a new reservation + ledger dir), or report the board
and stop.

### Durable progress ledger

Conversation memory does not survive compaction; a controller that loses its place has
re-dispatched already-landed sprints — the most expensive failure mode. Keep a per-wave ledger:

- Create `.claude/sprint-orchestration/` with a self-ignoring `.gitignore`
  (`printf '*\n' > .claude/sprint-orchestration/.gitignore` — runtime scratch, never
  committed), then a subdirectory per wave: `.claude/sprint-orchestration/W-<id>/`.
- Maintain `W-<id>/wave-progress.md`: one line per sprint —
  `S-NNN | planned(date) | decisions | started | worktree=… | status=dispatched|DONE|PLAN_GAP|landed`.
  Update it as agents report and as you land.
- Maintain `W-<id>/wave-plan.md`: members table (ID, verdict, plan_date, touches summary),
  constraint findings, contract edges checked, pending decisions, dispatch checklist,
  review dispositions. This is where planning-pass state survives compaction — including
  the planning-worktree path while Step 2 is in flight.
- Execution subagents write `W-<id>/S-NNN-report.md` (per-deliverable commits, gate/test
  results, acceptance-criteria evidence citations, review outcome, deviations from brief,
  deferred items) — it outlives the worktree and feeds Step 5's evidence check and Step 6's
  review. Step 5 adds `W-<id>/S-NNN-docs-draft.md`.
- After a compaction, trust this ledger + `git log` + `/sprint board` (the `in-progress/`
  set and `wave:` reservations on `main` are authoritative), never recollection. Your wave
  id is in the ledger dir name and in the reservation commit. Never start or land a sprint
  already marked `landed`.

### Roles and models

The **master** is this interactive session — assumed to run the strongest available model
(e.g. Fable). Its judgment is spent where it is cheapest and highest-leverage: orchestrating,
advising blocked agents, adjudicating findings lists and reports. It never reads diffs or
sprint bodies — that is what keeps it alive across a whole wave.

All wave subagents — `sprint-planner`, `sprint-executor`, `wave-planner`, `reviewer` — are
pinned `model: sonnet` in their agent definitions. There is **no spawn-time model override**,
so the definition is the only thing standing between a wave and N executors silently running
on the master's model: always dispatch by agent name, never as a generic subagent. Executors'
children inherit the same tier via their own definitions (`reviewer`) or the dispatch default.

### Running waves from multiple sessions

Two (or more) terminal sessions can drive concurrent waves on the same repo. What makes it
safe, and what to do differently:

- **Reservation before planning.** Step 1.5's locked `wave:` commit is what prevents two
  sessions from picking the same members or overlapping `touches:` — never skip it when
  waving, even solo (it costs one fast commit and makes your roster visible to the other
  session's `/sprint board`).
- **The ledger stays clean.** All planning edits happen in the wave's own planning worktree
  (2b); orchestrator edits on the primary happen only inside a lock window (2f). If you find
  the primary checkout dirty and you didn't dirty it, stop and ask the user — another
  session may be mid-transaction gone wrong.
- **Longer lock waits.** Detect a live foreign wave via `/sprint board` (reserved members,
  in-flight sprints you don't own). When one exists, pass `--wait 900` to `start.sh` and
  `merge-sprint.sh prepare` — the other wave's completion legitimately holds the lock across
  prepare→land→finish. On exit 75: `lock.sh status`; a live holder (label `start-*`/`land-*`/
  `reserve-*`, age under an hour) → retry once with `--wait 900`; older → surface to the
  user; **never steal silently**.
- **Keep lock-held pauses short.** Pre-draft completion docs (Step 5.1) so the exit-4 pause
  is seconds. The exit-3 gate re-run is irreducible; the other wave's 900s wait absorbs it.
- **Pushes cannot race.** Every locked transaction pulls `--ff-only` before mutating and
  pushes before releasing the lock — commit+push is one critical section. A failed push
  leaves the local commit intact with instructions; resolve before proceeding.
- **Stale reservations.** A crashed session leaves its `wave:` fields behind. Recovery is
  `reserve-wave.sh --release W-<id>` — but like `lock.sh steal`, only with the user's
  explicit confirmation that the other session is really dead.
- **Cross-wave staleness.** The other wave lands sprints while yours runs; your members'
  read-only premises can rot. Step 3.1's re-check catches it before dispatch; the executor's
  verify-the-brief step is the backstop.

### Dynamic workflow variant (optional)

If the **Workflow tool** is available in this environment, the two fan-outs — and only
those — can run as deterministic workflow scripts with schema-validated returns (no
text-parsing of planner verdicts / executor statuses) and resume-from-runId:

- Step 2b → `scripts/sprint/workflows/plan-wave.mjs` (args: wave id, roster with file paths
  in the planning worktree, repo root, landed-since list).
- Step 4 → `scripts/sprint/workflows/exec-wave.mjs` (args: wave id, sprints with worktree
  paths, repo root).

Everything else is unchanged and stays in-session: the decision round needs interactive
AskUserQuestion; starts, completions, and reservations are lock-serialized shell transactions
whose exit codes (2/3/4/75) demand in-session judgment. Note one tradeoff: workflow agents
return structured results but cannot be continued via SendMessage after the workflow ends —
a BLOCKED executor inside a workflow surfaces its question in the workflow result, and the
advisor loop answers it via a fresh dispatch (pointing at the branch's committed work) instead
of a continuation. When the Workflow tool is absent, the Agent-tool dispatch described in
Steps 2b/4 is the primary path — the two are interchangeable per wave.

---

## Planning dispatch prompt (sprint-planner subagent)

Adapt and send one per non-skipped member (fill the brackets; the agent definition at
`.claude/agents/sprint-planner.md` carries the full duties):

> You are the sprint-planner subagent for **S-NNN**. Follow your agent instructions
> (`.claude/agents/sprint-planner.md`).
>
> - Sprint file (edit ONLY this file, do not commit — it lives in the wave's planning
>   worktree): `<absolute path to backlog file inside .claude/worktrees/wave-W-<id>-plan>`
> - Repo root: `<absolute repo root>`
> - Wave roster: `S-AAA touches [...]; S-BBB touches [...]`
> - Landed since this sprint's plan_date: `S-CCC (<done-file path>), …` (or "none")
>
> Verify and deepen the sprint file against the CURRENT code, set `plan_date` if it reaches
> the readiness bar, and return the structured ≤20-line report from your instructions.

For a **post-start PLAN_GAP repair**, say so explicitly, point at the in-progress copy inside
the sprint's worktree, and remind it to commit on the sprint branch as
`S-NNN: revise plan — <reason>`.

## Execution dispatch prompt (sprint-executor subagent)

Adapt and send one per sprint — the agent definition at `.claude/agents/sprint-executor.md`
carries the full duties; the prompt carries only the per-sprint variables:

> You are the `sprint-executor` subagent for sprint **S-NNN** — follow your agent
> instructions (`.claude/agents/sprint-executor.md`).
>
> - Worktree (work ONLY here, via `git -C` / absolute paths): `<absolute worktree path>`
> - Repo root: `<absolute repo root>`
> - Wave ledger dir (your report goes here): `<repo-root>/.claude/sprint-orchestration/W-<id>/`
>
> Execute the sprint per your instructions and return the structured status (≤15 lines).

## Failure handling

- **A planning subagent dies mid-edit:** its roster file may be dirty — in the wave's
  planning worktree, not the ledger. Recovery is
  `git -C .claude/worktrees/wave-W-<id>-plan checkout -- docs/sprints/backlog/S-NNN-*.md`,
  then re-dispatch or `--drop` the member (wave-plan.md records which files were handed to
  planners). The primary checkout was never at risk.
- **A member is rejected at the decision round:** pre-start this is cheap — keep the
  committed deepening, `reserve-wave.sh --drop W-<id> S-NNN`, note it in wave-plan.md.
  Removing members preserves pairwise disjointness; only *adding* members forces a re-check.
- **An execution subagent returns BLOCKED / NEEDS_CLAIM:** the advisor loop — answer or
  claim, then **continue the same agent** (SendMessage). Re-dispatch a fresh `sprint-executor`
  only if the agent died (its committed work persists on the branch; tell the fresh agent to
  read `git -C <worktree> log` first).
- **PLAN_GAP:** the brief is wrong — fix the brief, don't abandon the sprint. Re-dispatch a
  `sprint-planner` in post-start mode against the **worktree copy** of the in-progress file
  (edits commit on the sprint branch); run `claims.mjs add` under the lock for any touches
  growth it reports (mirror in the branch copy); run a mini decision round if it raises
  questions; then re-dispatch execution. If the user instead decides to pull the sprint back
  entirely: `scripts/sprint/unstart.sh S-NNN --reason "…"` (refuses if the branch carries
  deliverable commits — then prefer `rejected/` or completion; clears the `wave:` reservation),
  then remove the worktree and branch it prints.
- **Reservation race (`reserve-wave.sh` exit 2):** another session reserved or started a
  member between your Step 1 and Step 1.5 — recompute the wave and re-confirm.
- **Start race (`start.sh` exit 2):** backlog file gone (another agent started it) or the
  sprint is reserved by another wave — drop it from your roster.
- **Lock busy (exit 75):** another session/wave holds it — follow the exit-75 protocol in
  "Running waves from multiple sessions". Never steal silently.
- **Orphaned worktree** (sprint in `in-progress/` with no worktree, or vice-versa): see
  `/sprint board`'s orphan check before re-dispatching.
- **Abandoning a wave:** release what you hold — `reserve-wave.sh --release W-<id>` for
  unstarted members; started members are individually `unstart`ed or completed. Leave the
  ledger dir for the post-mortem.
