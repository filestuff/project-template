# Changelog

All notable changes to the project-template payload. Downstream repos read these
entries during `/template-upgrade` — write every bullet for the person running a
repo that installed this template, not for template maintainers.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-04

- `docs/ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md` now opens with a 7-rung decision ladder run
  before writing code (build at all? > reuse the codebase > stdlib > platform >
  installed dep > one line > minimum code), and gains two sections: root-cause-
  over-symptom bug fixing (grep all callers, fix shared code once) and hard
  safety carve-outs that are never simplified away (trust-boundary validation,
  data-loss error handling, security, accessibility, explicit requests). The
  smell table gained matching rows.
- `/review` and the `reviewer` agent check the ladder (reimplementation of
  something that already exists) and root-cause placement of bug fixes, and are
  told not to flag the safety carve-outs as YAGNI/KISS violations.
  `/code-simplifier` and `/debug` carry the matching guardrails; the sprint
  PROTOCOL's GREEN step points at the ladder.
- Skills gained explicit Boundaries and null-result rules (sprint, plan, adr,
  debug, review, explain-changes, code-simplifier): each states what's out of
  scope and which skill to hand off to, and what a clean/empty result looks like
  so agents don't invent findings or manufacture edits.
- All changes are to managed files — `/template-upgrade`'s three-way merge
  applies them and your local customizations survive as usual. No migrations.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-04

- `scripts/template/upgrade.mjs` now passes strict repo-wide Biome lint rules
  (`Object.hasOwn` instead of prototype `hasOwnProperty`, template literals
  instead of string concatenation, `matchAll` instead of an assign-in-expression
  `exec` loop, and removal of an unused `void`'d variable). Behavior-identical —
  a post-fix render of v1.0.0 is byte-identical to the pre-fix render. If your
  repo lints `scripts/` with Biome (e.g. a whole-repo `pnpm check`), upgrading
  clears those errors; if you already applied the same fixes locally, the
  three-way merge lands clean.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-04

- Versioned template: a root `VERSION` file plus a committed
  `.claude/template-manifest.json` in every downstream install pin exactly which
  template version, commit, tier, and placeholder values were installed.
- Automated update checks: `scripts/template/update-check.sh` runs silently before
  every `/sprint` command and surfaces newer template versions (with snooze and
  opt-out); a new `/template-upgrade` skill walks the whole upgrade.
- Three-way upgrade engine (`scripts/template/upgrade.mjs`): fetches old and new
  template versions, re-renders both with your placeholder values, and merges —
  your local customizations are preserved, conflicts get standard markers, and
  nothing is ever deleted without asking.
- Wave push batching: parallel waves now push `main` at three checkpoints instead
  of after every lifecycle commit (~13 → 1 CI-triggering pushes per wave), via the
  new `scripts/sprint/push-main.sh`.
- Sprint ledger commits now carry `[skip ci]` — lifecycle bookkeeping (start,
  reserve, unstart, claims, plan, INDEX/ROADMAP regen) no longer burns CI
  minutes. The `sprint: complete` commit deliberately does not: its push lands
  the code and must trigger CI.
- CI-hygiene audit at bootstrap and on every upgrade: proposes `paths-ignore`
  filters and `concurrency` groups for your GitHub workflows (offered, never
  auto-applied).
- Migrations convention: `migrations/vX.Y.Z.sh` scripts run inside the downstream
  repo when an upgrade crosses that version — for structural changes a file merge
  can't express (frontmatter backfills, skeleton regens, renames).
