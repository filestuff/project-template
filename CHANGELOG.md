# Changelog

All notable changes to the project-template payload. Downstream repos read these
entries during `/template-upgrade` — write every bullet for the person running a
repo that installed this template, not for template maintainers.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-04

- Versioned template: a root `VERSION` file plus a committed
  `.claude/template-manifest.json` in every downstream install pin exactly which
  template version, commit, tier, and placeholder values were installed.
- Automated update checks: `scripts/template/update-check.sh` runs silently before
  every `/sprint` command and surfaces newer template versions (with snooze and
  opt-out); a new `/template-upgrade` skill walks the whole upgrade.
- Three-way upgrade engine (`scripts/template/upgrade.mjs`): fetches old and new
  template versions, re-renders both with your placeholder values, and merges —
  your local customizations are preserved, conflicts get standard markers, and
  nothing is ever deleted without asking.
- Wave push batching: parallel waves now push `main` at three checkpoints instead
  of after every lifecycle commit (~13 → 1 CI-triggering pushes per wave), via the
  new `scripts/sprint/push-main.sh`.
- Sprint ledger commits now carry `[skip ci]` — lifecycle bookkeeping (start,
  reserve, unstart, claims, plan, INDEX/ROADMAP regen) no longer burns CI
  minutes. The `sprint: complete` commit deliberately does not: its push lands
  the code and must trigger CI.
- CI-hygiene audit at bootstrap and on every upgrade: proposes `paths-ignore`
  filters and `concurrency` groups for your GitHub workflows (offered, never
  auto-applied).
- Migrations convention: `migrations/vX.Y.Z.sh` scripts run inside the downstream
  repo when an upgrade crosses that version — for structural changes a file merge
  can't express (frontmatter backfills, skeleton regens, renames).
